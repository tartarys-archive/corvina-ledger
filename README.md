# Corvina Keepers — Archive

This repository serves as the **foundational archive** of the Corvina Keepers project.

It preserves the early documents, standards, and conceptual drafts that led to the
emergence of Corvina Keepers as a cultural and custodial framework.

## What is Corvina Keepers?

**Corvina Keepers** is a community-driven initiative dedicated to the guardianship of
cultural, symbolic, and physical heritage through transparent, non-coercive digital standards.

The project explores how **physical artifacts**, **documented value**, and **community witnessing**
can coexist with modern cryptographic systems — without speculation, hype, or forced trust.

## Purpose of this Archive

This archive exists to:

- Preserve historical versions of white papers and standards
- Provide timestamped public references
- Maintain transparency of conceptual evolution
- Prevent loss or rewriting of original intent

Nothing here is hidden.  
Nothing here is enforced.

---

## Active Repositories

The current active standards and documents include:

- **Corvina Keepers White Paper**
- **Corvina Sigil Standard**
- **Yellow–Black (Y-B) Model**
- **Cultural & Signature frameworks**

Each repository is public, auditable, and self-contained.

## Philosophy

No promises.  
No coercion.  
No artificial scarcity.

Only guardianship, continuity, and responsibility.

Those who understand, will stay.  
Those who do not, may move on freely.

## What is the Corvina Ledger

This repository serves as the chronological record of the Corvina Keepers.
It documents verifiable events, milestones, and observations as they occurred.

No past entry is altered.
No future meaning is pre-assumed.
Interpretation belongs to the reader.
This is not a white paper, not a roadmap, and not a promise.

## Ledger Structure & Interpretation Notes

This repository functions as a numbered chronological ledger.

Each entry records a decision, observation, or finalized reference state
at the time it occurred. Once committed, entries are not altered.

### Numbering
- Entries are sequential (0000, 0001, …)
- Gaps are intentional and reflect periods without formal recording
- New context is added only via new entries

### Sealed vs Living Entries
- Entries marked as sealed represent finalized reference states
- Subsequent changes or extensions do not modify sealed entries
- They are expressed through new ledger entries

### Integrity Model
- Archived documents are referenced via SHA-256 hashes
- Hashes are the canonical integrity anchors
- Public mirrors do not redefine canonical records

This ledger does not prescribe outcomes.
It preserves sequence, context, and traceability.

Interpretation remains the responsibility of the reader.
