# Corvina Ledger — Entry 0005a

## Title
Chain Selection Rationale — BNB Smart Chain (BSC)

## Date
2026-01-09

## Purpose
This entry documents the rationale behind selecting BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
as the execution environment for Corvina Sigil Jeton (CSJ) v1.

The decision prioritizes operational clarity, cost efficiency,
and demonstrability over ideological maximalism.

## Selected Chain

- Network: BNB Smart Chain
- Consensus: Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA)
- EVM Compatibility: Yes
- Tooling: MetaMask, Remix, standard ERC-20 tooling

## Rationale

### 1. Low and Predictable Transaction Costs
- Enables minting, transfers, and demonstrations with minimal financial risk
- Suitable for early-stage experimentation and proof-of-operation
- Prevents gas-cost friction from distorting participation

### 2. EVM Compatibility
- Standard Solidity contracts
- Wide auditability
- Easy migration path to other EVM chains if needed

### 3. Human-Scale Governance
- Corvina Keepers emphasizes human accountability over fully automated systems
- BSC provides sufficient decentralization without operational overhead

### 4. Accessibility
- Broad wallet support
- Familiar tooling for auditors, developers, and observers
- Low barrier for future participants

## What This Choice Is NOT

- Not a statement against Ethereum
- Not a claim of maximal decentralization
- Not a long-term exclusivity commitment

The chain is a tool, not an ideology.

## Forward Compatibility

Future Corvina Sigil versions MAY:
- deploy on additional chains
- bridge representations
- migrate governance layers

Any such move requires explicit ledger entry and community acknowledgment.

## Status
BNB Smart Chain selected for CSJ v1 deployment.

## Ledger Integrity
This rationale is recorded immutably as part of the Corvina Ledger.
