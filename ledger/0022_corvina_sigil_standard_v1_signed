# 0022 – Standard Sealing & Document Custody Consolidation
2026.01.20.
## Timestamp
Recorded upon cryptographic verification of the Corvina Sigil Standard v1 signed document.

## Context
With the completion of the Corvina Sigil Standard v1 physical signing, scanning, PDF generation,
and SHA-256 hashing, the Corvina Keepers project reaches a critical consolidation milestone.

This entry formalizes the sealing process of foundational documents and defines
their custodial status within the Corvina Keepers framework.

## Documents Covered by Sealing Protocol
The following documents are designated as **Sealed Foundational Artifacts**:

1. Corvina Keepers White Paper v1 (signed, hashed, ledger-recorded)
2. Corvina Sigil Standard v1 (signed, hashed, ledger-recorded)
3. CST Standard v1
4. Y-B Standard v1

Each document exists simultaneously in three layers:
- Physical signed original
- Digital scan (PDF)
- Cryptographic fingerprint (SHA-256)

## Cryptographic Proof
Corvina Sigil Standard v1  
SHA-256 hash:

cf573b73f77d263ba665902b6d8c73bf2dc5af05193d026c9f82c05c6aa91cb1

This hash serves as the immutable identifier of the document state at the moment of sealing.

## Custodial Status
All sealed documents are hereby placed under **Corvina Keepers Custodianship**.

Custodianship implies:
- No unilateral alteration
- No silent replacement
- No version drift without ledger disclosure
- Any future publication must match the recorded hash or be explicitly declared as a new version

## Disclosure Policy
At this stage, the sealed documents are **not required to be publicly distributed**.

Public release, IPFS anchoring, or repository publication may occur later,
provided the released file matches the recorded cryptographic fingerprint.

The ledger entry itself constitutes sufficient proof of existence, authorship,
and temporal priority.

## Purpose
This sealing step ensures:
- Long-term integrity of foundational standards
- Clear separation between v1 artifacts and future revisions
- Auditability without dependency on third-party platforms

## Status
Sealing completed.  
Custodial phase initiated.

## Closing Statement
From this point forward, the Corvina Keepers standards exist as
**immutable historical anchors**, not editable drafts.

Any evolution belongs to v2 and beyond — never to silent revision.

Only Honor.
