# 0017a – Document Hashing Intent (Pre-Physical Finalization)

## Status
Intent Declaration  
Pre-Minting / Pre-Signature Phase
2026.01.10.

## Context
At this stage, all Version 1 documents of the Corvina Keepers initiative
(Corvina Keepers White Paper v1, Corvina Sigil Standard v1, CST Standard v1, Y-B Standard v1)
exist in finalized digital PDF form and are publicly timestamped via GitHub repositories.

No physical printing, signing, or hashing has yet occurred.

## Intent
This entry formally records the intent that:

- All finalized PDF documents will be:
  - physically printed,
  - manually signed by the Founder,
  - and only then cryptographically hashed (SHA-256).

- The resulting hashes will serve as:
  - immutable fingerprints of the signed physical documents,
  - anchors for subsequent NFT witnesses,
  - and references for treasury custody records.

## Principle
Hashing SHALL NOT precede physical finalization.

Digital hashes are considered valid **only if** they correspond
to documents that have been:
- printed,
- reviewed in physical form,
- and signed.

This preserves the primacy of the physical act over the digital representation.

## Non-Action Statement
No hashes are generated at this stage.
No NFTs are minted at this stage.
No on-chain actions are performed at this stage.

This entry exists solely to prevent retroactive ambiguity.

## Forward Reference
The first document hashes will be recorded in a subsequent ledger entry,
following physical printing and signature.

**Ledger Role:** Boundary Marker  
**Prevents:** Backdating, retroactive hashing, digital-first substitution  
**Affirms:** Physical → Cryptographic → On-Chain sequence
