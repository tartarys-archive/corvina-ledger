Date: 2026.01.09.
Repository: corvina-ledger

Summary:
This entry records the structure, logic, and allocation of the initial
Corvina Sigil Jeton (CSJ) minting, distinguishing between
demonstration-based physical custody and intellectual custodianship.

Declared Initial Supply:
- Total CSJ supply: 369,000

────────────────────────────
I. Physical Banknote Demonstration Mint
────────────────────────────

Purpose:
To demonstrate the physical custody → digitization → minting process
using historical banknotes.

Parameters:
- Archived historical banknotes: 10
- Minting ratio: 1 banknote = 1 CSJ
- Total CSJ minted for banknotes: 10

Allocation:
- Founder allocation: 9 CSJ
- Community (Corvina Keepers Treasury): 1 CSJ

Result:
This establishes a working example of physical asset–backed minting
under custodial oversight.

────────────────────────────
II. Intellectual Custody Mint
────────────────────────────

Remaining CSJ after demonstration mint:
- 369,000 − 10 = 368,990 CSJ

These CSJ represent custodial responsibility for intellectual assets
voluntarily entrusted by the Founder to the Corvina Keepers community.

Intellectual Assets Covered:
1. Corvina Keepers White Paper
2. Corvina Sigil Jeton (CSJ) Standard
3. Y-B Standard
4. Cultural Signature Token (CST) Standard

Allocation Principle:
The intellectual custody mint is split evenly between
the Founder and the Community.

Allocation:
- Founder allocation: 184,495 CSJ
- Community (Corvina Keepers Treasury): 184,495 CSJ

────────────────────────────
III. Final Allocation Summary

- From banknotes: 9 CSJ
- From intellectual custody: 184,495 CSJ
- Founder total: 184,504 CSJ

Community (Treasury) Total:
- From banknotes: 1 CSJ
- From intellectual custody: 184,495 CSJ
- Community total: 184,496 CSJ

Total Supply Check:

────────────────────────────

- Allocation is transparent, auditable, and ledger-recorded
- Community guardianship is structurally embedded from genesis

Status:
Approved for recording as Ledger Entry 0014.
