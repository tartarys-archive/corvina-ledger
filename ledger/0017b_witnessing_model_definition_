# 0017b – Witnessing Model Definition (Post-Signature, Pre-Mint)

## Status
Model Definition  
Pre-Minting / Post-Physical Finalization Phase
2026.01.10.

## Context
Following the physical printing and manual signing of the finalized Version 1 documents,
the Corvina Keepers system transitions from intent to verifiable witnessing.

This entry defines the witnessing logic that will govern:
- document authenticity,
- custody claims,
- and historical traceability.

## Witnessing Model Overview
The Corvina Keepers witnessing model is based on a three-layer structure:

1. **Physical Layer**
   - Signed paper documents
   - Archived banknotes
   - Physical custody under treasury control

2. **Cryptographic Layer**
   - SHA-256 hashes derived from physically signed documents
   - Hashes serve as immutable fingerprints
   - No content is embedded on-chain, only cryptographic references

3. **On-Chain Witness Layer**
   - NFTs minted as witnesses, not ownership claims
   - NFTs reference hashes, timestamps, and ledger entries
   - NFTs attest that a physical object existed, was verified, and was accepted into custody

## Core Principle
NFTs do not replace physical reality.  
They **testify** to it.

The NFT is a witness, not the artifact.

## Authority and Roles
- Witness NFTs are minted under Founder authority in v1
- Treasury custody is declared off-chain and referenced on-chain
- Community witnessing is introduced in later versions

## Non-Transfer of Meaning
Transfer of an NFT does not imply transfer of:
- physical ownership,
- custodial authority,
- or governance rights,
unless explicitly defined in future protocol versions.

## Forward Compatibility
This witnessing model is intentionally minimal in v1.
Expanded roles (multi-witness, quorum validation, community attestations)
are reserved for v2 and beyond.

## Forward Reference
The first witness NFTs will be minted only after:
- document signatures are completed,
- hashes are computed,
- and custody declarations are recorded.
