Title: First Wallet Architecture Finalized

Date: 2026.01.09.
Repository: corvina-ledger

Description:
The initial wallet architecture of the Corvina Keepers project has been finalized.

A two-address model has been established on the BNB network:

1. Founder / Minter Wallet  
   - Holds minting authority for the initial smart contract (v1).
   - Responsible for the first demonstration mint.
   - Acts as the operational key during the bootstrap phase.

2. Treasury Wallet  
   - Serves as the custody and distribution address.
   - Receives minted Corvina Sigil Jetons before allocation.
   - Represents the proto-community treasury under transparent logging.

Design Principles:
- Minimal complexity for v1 to reduce attack surface.
- Clear separation of authority and custody.
- Full traceability via public blockchain and GitHub ledger.
- Pause functionality planned after initial mint to prevent uncontrolled issuance.

Scope:
This architecture is intentionally simple and temporary.
It exists solely to demonstrate the minting, custody, and allocation model in practice.

Future governance, multi-signature control, and expanded roles
are explicitly deferred to v2 and beyond.

Status:
Completed and operational.
