 CORVINA KEEPERS — LEDGER ENTRY 0028

Date: 2026.02.02.
Ledger ID: 0028
Event: Verifiable Contract Migration & Treasury Reserve Establishment
Status: Final / Canonical
Network: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)

Background and Rationale

The originally deployed CSJ smart contract could not be verified on-chain due to technical constraints unrelated to supply intent, allocation design, or custodial principles.

To ensure long-term transparency, auditability, and historical clarity, a new smart contract was deployed and successfully verified on BscScan.

This action constitutes a technical migration for verification purposes and does not represent a reset, expansion, or alteration of the White Paper v1 genesis supply.

Canonical Genesis Supply (Unchanged)

The White Paper v1 defined a fixed and indivisible genesis supply of 369,000 CSJ, which remains unchanged and canonized.

Token: Corvina Sigil Jeton

Symbol: CSJ

Decimals: 0

Canonical Genesis Supply: 369,000 CSJ

Genesis Nature: indivisible units

Treasury Reserve Establishment

In addition to the canonical genesis supply, a Treasury Reserve has been created under the verified contract.

Treasury Reserve Allocation (Locked):
1,000,000 CSJ
Treasury Reserve Address:
0xA695a5FbE5db9B0A9bA70052597B5Fe748883452

The Treasury Reserve:

is explicitly excluded from the canonical genesis supply,

is not part of the circulating supply,

is held under custodial control,

may only be released upon verified new deposits entering Corvina Keepers guardianship.

Any release from the Treasury Reserve constitutes a post-genesis historical event and must be recorded in a separate ledger entry.

Canonical Statement

With this ledger entry:

The verified CSJ smart contract is formally canonized.

The White Paper v1 genesis supply of 369,000 CSJ remains intact and unchanged.

The Founder and Treasury Base allocations are reaffirmed under a verifiable contract.

A custodial Treasury Reserve is formally established to support future, deposit-backed expansion without retroactive alteration.

Ledger Entry 0028 supersedes all prior non-verifiable contract references while preserving full historical continuity.

Ledger 0028 is sealed.
