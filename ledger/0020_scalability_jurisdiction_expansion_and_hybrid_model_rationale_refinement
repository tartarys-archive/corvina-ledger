# 0020 — Scalability, Jurisdiction Expansion, and Hybrid Model Rationale Refinement
2026.01.12.
## Context

Following the publication of the initial Corvina Keepers White Paper and Standards (v1), an external question emerged regarding the long-term scalability of the model, specifically:

- How the archival and minting framework could be extended beyond Hungarian historical banknotes
- Whether the system is inherently limited to a single national context
- How expansion can occur without compromising trust, custody integrity, or auditability

This ledger entry records the clarified position of the Founder regarding scalability, jurisdictional expansion, and the role of the hybrid custody model.

## Scalability by Design, Not by Assumption

The Corvina Keepers framework is intentionally **non-global by default**.

Scalability is not treated as an automatic consequence of technology, but as a **governance decision** grounded in:

- Cultural legitimacy
- Archival competence
- Custodial capacity
- Community trust

Expansion is therefore **opt-in, staged, and ledger-governed**, not implicit.

## Jurisdiction Expansion Principles

Expansion to additional countries or historical monetary systems is considered feasible **only under the following principles**:

1. **Discrete Jurisdiction Modules**  
   Each country or monetary tradition constitutes a separate archival domain, with its own ruleset, expert validation, and documentation standards.

2. **Local Expertise Requirement**  
   Inclusion of foreign banknotes requires qualified numismatic or historical expertise capable of:
   - Authenticity verification
   - Condition assessment
   - Historical context validation

3. **Ledger-First Admission**  
   Any new jurisdiction must be introduced via a formal ledger entry prior to:
   - Archival intake
   - NFT creation
   - Jeton minting

4. **Non-Uniform Valuation**  
   No assumption is made that one physical unit equals one jeton across jurisdictions. Valuation models may differ by:
   - Rarity
   - Condition
   - Historical relevance
   - Cultural significance

## Hybrid Custody Model — Refined Rationale

The hybrid custody model (physical custody + digital representation) is reaffirmed as a **deliberate long-term security strategy**, not a transitional compromise.

Key refinements:

- **Physical custody** provides:
  - Material scarcity
  - Cultural anchoring
  - Quantum-resilient value preservation

- **Digital custody (NFT / on-chain records)** provides:
  - Global visibility
  - Verifiable provenance
  - Immutable audit trails

The combination mitigates risks inherent in purely digital or purely physical systems.

---

## Why Hybrid Matters for Expansion

As jurisdictional scope increases, so do risks related to:

- Digital-only trust assumptions
- Cryptographic uncertainty over decades
- Regulatory and technological shifts

The hybrid model allows Corvina Keepers to expand **without collapsing into abstraction**, preserving tangible anchors across cultures and eras.

---

## Forward Position

- Jurisdiction expansion is **explicitly deferred to v2 and beyond**
- v1 remains intentionally limited to demonstrate clarity, not scale
- Any future expansion will be:
  - Ledger-recorded
  - Community-reviewed
  - Technically conservative
  - Culturally respectful

This entry does not authorize expansion.  
It defines the **conditions under which expansion may later occur**.

---

## Closing Note

Scalability is not measured by how fast a system grows,  
but by how long it remains trustworthy.
