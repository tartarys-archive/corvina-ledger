Ledger Entry 0015
Title: Minting Authority, Control Model, and Pause Logic
Date: 2026.01.09.
Repository: corvina-ledger

Summary:
This entry defines the authority model, control boundaries,
and safety mechanisms of the Corvina Sigil Jeton (CSJ)
smart contract v1.

The goal is to enable a single, demonstrative initial mint
while preserving transparency, reversibility of process,
and future decentralization.

────────────────────────────
I. Minting Authority (v1)
────────────────────────────

Minting Authority:
- Role: Founder / Initial Custodian
- Control: Single address (Founder wallet)
- Network: BNB Chain (Mainnet)

Rationale:
At v1 stage, minting authority is intentionally centralized
to:
- minimize operational complexity,
- reduce coordination risk,
- allow rapid demonstration of the full custody → mint flow.

This authority exists solely to execute the initial mint
documented in Ledger 0014.

────────────────────────────
II. Minting Scope Limitation
────────────────────────────

Minting Rules (v1):
- Minting is permitted only once
- Minting occurs as a single transaction
- Total minted amount is capped by declared supply

After execution of the initial mint:
- No further minting is allowed
- Minting function becomes permanently inactive

This ensures:
- no inflation risk,
- no hidden secondary mint,
- no silent supply expansion.

────────────────────────────
III. Pause Mechanism
────────────────────────────

Pause Function:
- Enabled: Yes
- Scope: Minting only

Behavior:
- When paused, minting is disabled
- Token transfers remain enabled
- Treasury distribution remains possible

Purpose:
- Safety during deployment
- Emergency response capability
- Demonstration clarity during initial phase

The pause function does NOT:
- freeze user balances,
- restrict transfers,
- interfere with community onboarding.

────────────────────────────
IV. Governance Implications
────────────────────────────

This control model is explicitly temporary.

Future versions may introduce:
- multi-signature mint authority,
- community-governed mint approvals,
- role-based permissions,
- on-chain governance extensions.

These changes are intentionally deferred to v2+,
after real-world operation has been observed.

────────────────────────────
Principles Affirmed:
- Simplicity over premature decentralization
- Demonstration before expansion
- Authority paired with responsibility
- Ledger-first accountability

Status:
Approved for recording as Ledger Entry 0015.
