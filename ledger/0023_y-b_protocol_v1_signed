# 0023 – Y-B Protocol v1 Sealing & Custodial Registration
2026.01.20.
## Timestamp
Recorded upon cryptographic verification of the signed Y-B Protocol v1 document.

## Context
The Y-B Protocol defines the ethical and procedural framework for
witness-based protection, disclosure, and non-coercive governance
within the Corvina Keepers ecosystem.

With the completion of its physical signing, scanning, PDF generation,
and SHA-256 hashing, the protocol now transitions from draft state
into sealed custodial status.

## Document Sealed
- Y-B Protocol v1 (signed original, scanned PDF)

## Cryptographic Proof
Y-B Protocol v1  
SHA-256 hash:

549cfd2c09a80e852fe19a2ff31e1bbe335bf08fe363dba11a7a9ab64daf1f5e

This hash uniquely identifies the exact document state at the moment of sealing.

## Custodial Status
The Y-B Protocol v1 is hereby placed under **Corvina Keepers Custodianship**.

Custodianship implies:
- Preservation of the signed original
- Immutable reference via cryptographic fingerprint
- Protection against silent modification or substitution
- Explicit versioning for any future amendments

The protocol is considered **ethically binding** within the Corvina Keepers framework,
while remaining non-coercive and non-jurisdictional.

## Relationship to Other Sealed Artifacts
The Y-B Protocol v1 joins the following sealed foundational documents:
- Corvina Keepers White Paper v1
- Corvina Sigil Standard v1
- CST Standard v1

Together, these documents form the **normative and procedural spine**
of the Corvina Keepers system.

## Disclosure Policy
Public availability of the Y-B Protocol v1 may occur at any later stage,
provided that the distributed file matches the recorded hash.

Ledger publication itself constitutes proof of existence, authorship,
and temporal priority.

## Status
Sealing completed.  
Protocol enters custodial phase.

## Closing Statement
From this ledger entry onward, the Y-B Protocol v1 stands as a
fixed ethical reference point.

Governance may evolve.  
Standards may refine.  
But this protocol remains the declared moral baseline of the system.

Only Honor.
